# CosmoMC_plus_GammaPrime
This repository contains a customised version of [CosmoMC](https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC) containing [CAMB_GammaPrime_Growth](https://github.com/MinhMPA/CAMB_GammaPrime_Growth), a patch of the Boltzmann solver [CAMB](https://github.com/cmbant/CAMB).

It was used for the analysis on the $\gamma_L$ parametrisation in [arXiv:2305.16865](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16865).

To compile, download the source code and follow the installation instructions given in [CosmoMC](https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC).
